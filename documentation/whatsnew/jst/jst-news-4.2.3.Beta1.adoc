== Custom HTML Tag Validation

HTML validation in Eclipse Web Tools Luna has an annoying issue with custom HTML5 tags. It warns about any HTML tag name that is not mentioned in the HTML specification.
We contributed a patch to Eclipse Mars which allows to disable those warnings for any particular tag name (or a tag name mask, e.g. <ion-*>).
Though this was fixed in Eclipse Mars only we back ported this useful feature to JBoss Tools 4.2.3 which is based on Eclipse Luna SR2:
