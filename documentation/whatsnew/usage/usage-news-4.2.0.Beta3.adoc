== JVM name usage 

JVM name and architecture (32/64 bit) are now collected for usage statistics to help JBoss Tools team to learn more about how our users are using the tooling.
JBoss Tools also tracks events when the runtime detection mechanism creates a new server.

All information which is going to be collected is reflected in Preferences > JBoss Tools > Usage Reporting for you to review.

As always JBoss Tools will not send any information before a user have opted in, nor is there any personal information sent.
